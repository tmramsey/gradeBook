# Gradebook Assistant - Part 1 - Manipulating the DOM

## Assignment

Your task is to build a front-end application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application will act as a tool that a teacher could use to track and sort the grades from a classroom test. Over time, you will continuosly build upon this application by adding new features and improving old ones.

In part one, you will build a basic, non-functional nav bar, a form, and a container for storing the submitted grades.

The form will allow you to submit a students first name, last name, and test score. Once submitted, the score should be converted to a letter grade, then rendered to the screen in order. You can base your design on the wireframe below, but feel free to improvise and polish your design.
